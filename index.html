            <p>
                I am a passionate and motivated Computer Science graduate with a keen interest in software development and IT support. Throughout my work experiences, I have honed my skills in computer equipment service, installation, and diagnostics. I possess a solid foundation in various programming languages, including Python and Java, and a comprehensive understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. <br><br>

                My journey as a computer technician at Dom≈æale Secondary School equipped me with valuable expertise in database and network design, as well as software and applications development. During my internship at LEK d.d., I eagerly assisted users, managed equipment, and ensured seamless operations. <br><br>

                Intrigued by innovation, I recently developed an Android application dedicated to providing accurate weather forecasts based on users' locations. This project allowed me to apply my problem-solving skills and creativity effectively. <br><br>

                As an open-minded and communicative individual, I thrive in a team-oriented environment and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge. I take pride in being reliable and detail-oriented, delivering results that meet and exceed expectations. I am excited to further explore the realms of software development and contribute my expertise to meaningful projects that shape the future of technology.
